// Question Description
/*
    You are given two integer arrays pushed and popped, each with distinct values and of equal length. You are to validate whether the popped sequence could be the result of a series of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, where the pushed order is followed strictly.
    // Write a recursive function to check if the sequence is valid.

    Input:
    pushed: an array of integers representing the push order
    popped: an array of integers representing the expected pop order.

    Output:
    Return true if popped is a valid pop sequence from pushed using a stack, otherwise return false.

    Constraints:
    All values in pushed and popped are unique.
    pushed.length == popped.length

    example 1:

    pushed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    popped = [4, 5, 3, 2, 1]

    Output: true

    example 2:

    pushed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    popped = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2]

    Output: false

// write your code below;
/*
* return {boolean}

function isValidStackSequence (pushed, popped) {
